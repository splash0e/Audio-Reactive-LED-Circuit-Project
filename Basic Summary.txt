@ Audio Reactive LED Circuit Project

This repository contains a simple but effective circuits that allow an LED to blink based on music/audio signal from a speaker.
Generally, depends upon the Low Freq. generating form Amplifier's for the respective Driver Unit.

Components Used-
a)Resistor
b)Diode
c)LED (any colour)

Note-
LED show now effect under-
1.High Freq. 
2.Mid Freq.
3.Soft Low Freq. or Soft Base Freq.


Passive LED Blinker Circuit

a)No external power needed.

b)Blinks on bass hits or audio peaks.

c)Made using: LED, Diode, Resistor.

d)Very minimal speaker load (but some loss can occur).
Nigeligible losses can't be detected until measured, minimal or very low Losses in Audio/Details.
