1) Initial or Experimental Measurements-
| Component          | Value                                | Notes                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Resistor (R1)**  | 470Ω                                 | Limits current to LED                   |
| **Diode (D1)**     | 1N4148 or 1N4007                     | Protects LED from reverse polarity      |
| **LED**            | Any standard 2V LED (Red/Blue/Green) | Try ultra-bright ones for better visual |
| **Speaker Source** | 3W–20W Speaker Output                | Comes from speaker wire                 |

2) Alternate Measurements-

| Component         | Alternate Value           | Impact                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resistor (R1)** | 330Ω – 1kΩ                | Lower = brighter LED but risks LED damage, Higher = dimmer LED, safer |
| **Diode (D1)**    | 1N5819 (Schottky), 1N4001 | Works similarly, just slower than 1N4148                              |
| **LED**           | 3V white LED or RGB       | Just ensure resistor is adjusted accordingly                          |
| **Speaker Power** | Can work even from 0.5W   | But the LED may blink faintly                                         |



Using of Resistor of much lower value may increase load and may effect the overall Audio quality.
Try Experimenting with different values in order to achive better reults according to your Amplifier output and taking Speaker 
Rating as refrence
here my system out put(15w-25w)
Speaker of (20w) and of 4 ohm
